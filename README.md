<h2> About me 😊 </h2>
<p>Hello!✋ My name is Sara Rioseco and I'm 35 years-old. I'm currently living in Santiago, Chile 🇨🇱.</p>
<p>I used to be a translator 📖, but those times are over and gone. Now I'm doing something I'm more passionate about 🔥, and yes, you guessed it right: it's Web Developing! 💻</p>
<p>It was in late 2022 when I started this path and, since then, I've been studying 👩‍🎓 and doing some very fun projects 🚀, using technologies such as <strong>JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Node JS, React, Git/Github</strong> and <strong>more</strong>.</p>
<p>My goal is to be a seasoned full-stack developer 👩‍💻 in the future, but for now I'm mostly doing Front-End developments and still learning everyday.🌱 </p>

<p>One thing I cannot live without, besides <strong>coffee ☕</strong>, it's <strong>singing!</strong> As a matter of fact, I've been singing in choirs for almost 15 years 👩‍🎤 </p> 

<p><strong>Spanish 💬</strong> is my native language, but you can also contact me in <strong>English</strong> or <strong>Portuguese</strong>. Reach me at <a href=mailto:sara.rioseco@gmail.com>sara.rioseco@gmail.com</a> 💌</p>
