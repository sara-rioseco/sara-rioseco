<h2> About me ðŸ˜Š </h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Sara Rioseco and I'm 35 years-old. I'm currently living in Santiago, Chile CL.</p>
<p>I used to be a translator, but those times are over and gone. Now I'm doing something I'm more passionate about, and yes, you guessed it right: it's Web Developing! ðŸ’»</p>
<p>It was in late 2022 when I started this path and, since then, I've been studying and doing some very fun projects ðŸš€, using technologies such as <strong>JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Git/Github, Visual Studio Code</strong> and <strong>more</strong>.</p>
<p>My goal is to be a seasoned full-stack developer in the future, but for now I'm mostly doing Front-End developments and still learning everyday.ðŸŒ± </p>
<p><strong>Spanish ðŸ’¬</strong> is my native language, but you can also contact me in <strong>English</strong> or <strong>Portuguese</strong>. </p>
